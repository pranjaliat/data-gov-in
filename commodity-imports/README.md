#Insights From Country-wise Commodity Imports Of India


### 1) Commodity imports by number of countries that they're imported from

Notes:
* India is dependent on 190+ countries for electronic goods
* India is dependent only on a few countries for Jute, Wheat and Rice
* Commodities that come later down in the graph signify India's dependence on other countries

### 2) Commodities ordered by quantity of import (in tonnes)

Notes:
* India imports petroleum HEAVILY!
* Interestingly, India imports more tonnes of Tea than Iron/Steel, and more Spices(!) than Tea
* India imported a significant more tonnes of each of the top 3 in 2012-2013 than in 2011-2012

### 3) Commodities ordered by cost of import

Notes:
* Clearly, petroleum and gold imports are shaping India's economy - notice the scale of 1e15, that's 1000000000000000 Rupees

### 4) Change in the expenditure during 2011-12 and 2012-13 of imports

### 5) Change in quantity of import during 2011-12 and 2012-13

Notes:
* India needed a lot more Sugar, Vegetable Oil and Spices in 2012-13 as compared to 2011-12 - We're getting fatter, aren't we? ;)
* Petroleum seems to top all charts
* Why did India need significantly less amount of fertilizers in 2012-13 than in 2011-12 - what does this say about farming?

### 6) Juxtaposing change in quantity and change in expenditure

Notes:
* Gold expenditure has significantly risen but the quantity remains same - Gold prices!
* Does the gold-price-theory for increase in expenditure but no increase in quantity of import apply to these and others as well?
  * Ore & Metal Scrap
  * Organic Chemicals
  * Electronic goods
* Coal, Coke & Briquittes for some magical reason was imported a significant more amount in tonnes without costing anything - the same with spices - what story lies behind this?
